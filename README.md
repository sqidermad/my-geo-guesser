# Indonesia Geo Guesser
Indonesia Geo Guesser is a game that challenges your knowledge of Indonesian geography, while also allowing you to enjoy the sights and sounds of the country. The idea for this game came from my long distance relationship with my boyfriend, as we were looking for ways to have fun and connect during our video call sessions.

# How it Works
The game works by presenting you with a series of videos that showcase different cities and landmarks throughout Indonesia. You have to guess the name of the city or landmark that is displayed in the video. You have three tries to guess correctly, and your score is based on how quickly you can guess the correct answer. You can play solo, or you can invite friends to join and compete for the highest score.

# Why I Built It
I initially started playing Geoguesser and City Guesser, but found that the games were either too expensive or did not include Indonesia. I decided to create my own game using my own footage, as I love walking around the cities and capturing the sights and sounds of Indonesia. However, I don't currently have footage for all the cities and landmarks in Indonesia, so I am still in the process of filming more content.

# Technologies Used
This project is being built using Next.js and TypeScript, with the Leaflet library for the map display. I am also using my own footage for the videos.
